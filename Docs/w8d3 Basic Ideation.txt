Git Policies:
One master branch


Each collaborator has their development/[name], which should function as THEIR personal master branch.  The goal is for that branch to have a working version of the project at all times.


From the development/[name] branch, each collaborator can instantiate sub-feature branches, like: development/Alfred/feature/explosions


Brench conventions:
feature/
bug/
