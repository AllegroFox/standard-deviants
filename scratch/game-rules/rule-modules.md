# Rule Modules
The purpose of this document is to describe alternative (modular) algorithems that can be slotted in at different stages of play to create different game variants.

Slots for rule modules exist at the following points of play:

- __Objective Selection__ (the word/entity that seeds the answer pool)
  - (Eg., the pool that the objectives are selected/generated from)
- __Answer Pool Criteria__ (how valid answers are selected based on objective; what the players are asked to do)
  - (Eg., words starting with obj., words rhyming with obj., synonyms)
- __Scoring Calculation__ (how many points answers are worth)
  - __Wild-Cards__ (Score multipliers/bonuses/penalties based on various criteria like target starting letter, etc.)
- __Competition Rules__ (Are duplicate answers rewarded, punished; how?)
- __Round Duration__ (Static round time, correct answers reduce the clock, game ends when pool is depleted)

## Answer Pool Criteria
- Find synonyms for the Objective word
- Find rhyming words for the Objective word
- Find words that start with the Objective syllable


## Scoring Calculations:

- Valid answers are worth 1 point.
- Valid answers are worth points = to length.
- Valid answers have point multipliers = syllables.


## Competition Rules:

- Boggle Rules
  - Answers found by more than one player are retroactively worth 0 points.
- Originality Rewarded
  - Answers found the first time are worth more points for that player.
- Popularity penalized
  - Answer point value is divided evenly among those who guessed it.
- Collaboration
  - The room starts with a point pool that decreases towards zero as the timer runs down.  The goal is for everyone to work together to exhaust the answer pool, and then everyone gets the points remaining in the point pool.





## Wildcards

- Secret word selected from the answer pool that's worth bonus points.


## General Game Alternatives

- Select a word from the dictionary and publish its definition, plus clues (number of letters, a letter in its correct space, etc.)  First player to type the correct answer gets a point.
