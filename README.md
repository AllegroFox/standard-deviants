# Platform for Hosting Infinite Generativity

Final Project for Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp, Toronto 2018-08-22 Cohort

## Precis

Inspired by [BeZerk's flash-game, Acrophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia_(game)) The __Platform for Hosting Infinite Generativity__ (PHIG) is lobby and chatroom server for hosting language-based games.  Game rooms are instantiated from the lobby with the host player deciding on the game module to import; other players join the room to play that game.

Within the game room, game rounds will run in sequence with rest periods between each round.  Players will be prompted to participate in the rounds, and can chat independently at all times.
